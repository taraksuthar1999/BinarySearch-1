/**
 *A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 *Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
 *If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. 
 *In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
 * Output: 5
